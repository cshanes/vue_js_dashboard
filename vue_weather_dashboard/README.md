## TODO
* The tutorial mentions: "However, we encourage you to try out extracting data in the Highlights.vue, and send relevant data down to each child component — it’s a good practice exercise nonetheless!"
* Fix issue where it only gets data for current day. It should show data for +12 hours from now
